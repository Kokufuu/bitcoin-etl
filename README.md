# bitcoin-etl

## üìù Project Overview

**bitcoin-etl** is a practice data engineering project designed to build a complete end-to-end ETL pipeline for Bitcoin blockchain data.

The project goals are:

- To learn **pure Python application structure and idiomatic code design**.
- To practice **extracting, transforming, and loading large-scale time-series data** from blockchain sources.
- To integrate both **batch ingestion** (from a full Bitcoin node) and **streaming ingestion** (from mempool.space or similar live APIs).
- To perform **data analysis and visualisation** of Bitcoin network trends, transactions, and mempool metrics.
- To extend skills towards **Spark-based scalable pipelines** by reimplementing the ETL in PySpark after building the initial Python version.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Motivation

As a data engineer shifting from Java backend development, this project will help me:

- Solidify core Python programming skills.
- Apply data engineering concepts in a personally interesting domain (Bitcoin).
- Build a production-like pipeline with clear module structure, testing, and documentation.

üîß *This repository is under active development as part of continuous learning and skill expansion in Python data engineering.*
